# Third-party notices

Juniper is licensed under Apache License 2.0. Its runtime dependencies retain their
own licenses and notices; the exact versions are pinned in `pnpm-lock.yaml` and
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` when a native build is performed.

The principal direct dependencies are:

- React, React DOM, Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, and Prettier — MIT.
- Tauri and its plugins — MIT or Apache-2.0 as identified by their package
  metadata.
- Rust crates including Tokio, Reqwest, Serde, rusqlite, uuid, keyring, base64,
  hmac, and sha2 — licenses are recorded in each crate's published package
  metadata.

## Bundled fonts

Juniper ships three fonts inside the application bundle, installed from the
pinned `@fontsource` packages in `pnpm-lock.yaml`. No font is fetched at run
time. Each is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1
(https://openfontlicense.org), whose full text is included in the package's
`LICENSE` file:

- Inter — Copyright 2016 The Inter Project Authors
  (https://github.com/rsms/inter). Juniper's default interface font.
- Atkinson Hyperlegible Next — Copyright 2020-2024 The Atkinson Hyperlegible
  Next Project Authors (https://github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible-next).
  Offered as the high-legibility font.
- OpenDyslexic — Copyright (c) 2019-07-29, Abbie Gonzalez, with Reserved Font
  Name OpenDyslexic. Offered as the dyslexia-oriented font.

The fonts are redistributed unmodified; the OFL permits bundling them with
software under any license.

Release packaging should run a dependency license audit for the target bundle
and include any generated notices required by the selected platform.

## Android native runtime

Juniper's Android local runtime embeds the pinned `llama.cpp` source revision
declared in [`config/llama-cpp.json`](config/llama-cpp.json). `llama.cpp` and
the ggml components it builds are distributed under the MIT license by their
respective upstream copyright holders. The source checkout used for a build
is verified against the manifest commit before CMake continues.

The Android arm64 build also enables the upstream KleidiAI CPU backend. Its
compiled portions are Copyright 2024-2026 Arm Limited and/or its affiliates and
are licensed under Apache-2.0. The resolved upstream checkout contains no
`NOTICE` file. The complete Apache-2.0 terms shipped as Juniper's `LICENSE`
therefore also provide the applicable KleidiAI license text; this attribution
preserves the upstream copyright notice.

Juniper does not package `llama-server` on Android. The desktop release keeps
its separately built, pinned server runtime and is governed by the existing
desktop runtime build script.
