# Self-test for the release workflow's publication completeness guard.
#
# 0.3.0-rc.33 was published without its MSI, its DEB, and
# RELEASE-PROVENANCE.json: the publication action created the release and then
# failed part way through its uploads. The job failed, but the release stayed
# public and incomplete. release.yml now re-uploads whatever is missing and
# fails when the published release still lacks an artifact.
#
# This runs that step's script verbatim against a stub `gh`, so the guard is
# exercised rather than assumed:
#   complete - every artifact already published        -> pass, no upload
#   partial  - three assets missing, upload works      -> pass after re-upload
#   broken   - uploads never take effect               -> fail
#
